# Introduction

TiDB is developed by an open and friendly community. Everybody is cordially welcome to join the community and contribute to TiDB. There are several ways to interact with the community and to contribute to TiDB including filing bug reports, proposing new features or refactoring, joining discussions, or writing documentation.
