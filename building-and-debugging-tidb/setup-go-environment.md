# Setup go environment

Install `Go` version **1.13** or above. Refer to [How to Write Go Code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) for more information.

Define the `GOPATH` environment variable and modify `PATH` to access your Go binaries. A common setup is as follows \(You could always specify it based on your own flavor\):

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```
