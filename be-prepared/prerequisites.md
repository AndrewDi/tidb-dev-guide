# Prerequisites

Before getting a copy of the source code and building it, you may need to install the following things:

* `git`,  any version is acceptable
* `go`,  we are using go 1.13 at present

## macOS

**Install `git`**

```bash
brew install git
```

**Install `go`**

Download go binary package and unarchive it:

```bash
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.13.15.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar zxf go1.13.15.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
```

There are two environment variables:

* `$GOROOT`: the directory generated by the above `tar` command, which contains the executable `go` binary.
* `$GOPATH`: specifies the location of your workspace. It defaults to a directory named `go` inside your home directory. see more details here: [How to Write Go Code \(with GOPATH\)](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code).

After unarchiving the go binary package, you can set `$GOROOT`, `$GOPATH`, and `$PATH` environment variables in your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
GOROOT=/path/to/your/goroot
GOPATH=/path/to/your/gopath
PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```

You can run `git version` and `go version` to verify the installation.

After installing all the basic prerequisites, let's start to set-up set your IDE environment. You can pick one of the following articles which target at your favorite IDE:

* [Vim](setting-up-vim.md)
* [Emacs](setting-up-emacs.md)
* [Visual Studio Code](setting-up-visual-studio-code.md)
* [GoLand](setting-up-goland.md)
